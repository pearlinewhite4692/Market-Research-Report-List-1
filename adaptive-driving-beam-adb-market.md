<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dynamic Type</li><li>Static Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) refers to advanced headlight technology that adjusts the distribution of light to improve visibility while reducing glare for other drivers. The market for ADB can be divided into two main types: dynamic and static. Dynamic ADB systems actively alter the beam pattern based on real-time driving conditions, such as steering input or speed, enhancing safety and visibility. Static ADB systems have fixed beam patterns designed for specific driving scenarios, providing consistent illumination but lacking real-time adaptability.</p></p>
