<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Expanding Metal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully</li><li>Partially</li><li>Uncovered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-expanding metal stent market is segmented into three primary types: fully covered, partially covered, and uncovered stents. Fully covered stents have a complete polymer coating, minimizing tissue ingrowth and migration risks, making them ideal for specific applications. Partially covered stents feature a coating that covers only a portion, balancing tissue interaction and allowing some level of ingrowth. Uncovered stents, without any coating, facilitate maximum lumen patency but may have higher rates of restenosis and migration, suitable for different clinical scenarios.</p></p>
