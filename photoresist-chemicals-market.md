<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist chemicals market includes two main types: positive and negative photoresists. Positive photoresists become soluble when exposed to light, allowing the exposed areas to be washed away during development, creating patterns. They are ideal for high-resolution applications. Negative photoresists harden upon light exposure, making the unexposed areas soluble and removable. They are used for robust, durable patterns but offer lower resolution. Both are critical in semiconductor manufacturing, microfabrication, and PCB production, catering to different precision and durability requirements.</p></p>
