<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Monitoring Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) monitoring device market features several technologies, with two prominent types being Photoionization Detectors (PID) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductors (MOS). PIDs measure VOC concentrations by detecting ionized particles after exposure to ultraviolet light, offering high sensitivity and rapid response times. In contrast, MOS sensors utilize a semiconductor material that changes resistance in the presence of VOCs, providing a cost-effective and compact solution, though typically with lower sensitivity compared to PIDs. Both technologies serve diverse industrial and environmental monitoring applications.</p></p>
